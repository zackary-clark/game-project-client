# User Stories

- As an online TicTacToe player, I want to be able to signup and login to the service

- As a player I should be able to change my password when I am logged in

- As a player, after I am logged in I should be able to create a new game

    - That new game should be created locally

    - The new game should also be created in the server

- As a player, I should be able to click on squares in the game board to make marks on the board

    - Clicking an occupied square should notify me to pick a new square

    - The marks I make should be rotated between x and o if I'm playing single player

    - The game state should be updated both in local storage and in the server using the game-api

- As a player, I should be notified which token I am currently using

- As a player, I should be visually notified at the end of the game who won and then be able to start a new game

- As a player, I should be able to see my past games

    - This should include options for all games, complete games, and incomplete games

    - Stretch: be able to continue an unfinished game stored on the server

- Stretch: As a player, I want to be able to let an AI decide moves

    - I should be able to use this AI as an opponent

    - I should be able to use this AI to help me make my own moves
